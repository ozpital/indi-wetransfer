Upload directly to WeTransfer without leaving WordPress

== Description ==

Utilising the WeTransfer API (https://developers.wetransfer.com/) you can now place a WeTransfer upload form on your WordPress website with ease.
No longer do you need to send your users away from your site. Let them transfer files to WeTransfer and share the WeTransfer URL with you programmatically.

== Installation ==

1. Sign up to the WeTransfer API (https://developers.wetransfer.com/) and create a WeTransfer API Key to use with this plugin.
2. Upload the plugin files to the `/wp-content/plugins/ozpital-wpwetransfer` directory, or install the plugin through the WordPress plugins screen directly.
3. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' screen in WordPress
4. Use the Settings->Ozpital WPWeTransfer screen to apply your WeTransfer API Key
5. Use the shortcode `[ozpital-wpwetransfer]` to display in your posts/pages
6. Listen to the `ozpital-wpwetransfer-success` javascript event to handle a successful transfer programmatically. eg: `document.addEventListener('ozpital-wpwetransfer-success', function(event) { console.log(event); });`
